\begin{frame}[fragile]{Keeping track of versions}

Either alone or in a team, one main problem of software development is \textit{keeping
track of changes} on the source code.

\textbf{Why?} There are a number of reasons for this: bug fixing/hunting, keep
track of (team)work, code sharing, etc.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Let's suppose that we have a bug}

What if a bug just appeared in our application?

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{No code versioning}: Bug hunting only (no way to know why or when the bug is appeared)
  \item \textbf{``ZIP file" versioning}: Decompress each single ZIP file, diff file by file
  \item \textbf{with VCS}: 
\end{itemize}
